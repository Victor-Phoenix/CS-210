Project Summary
The project I chose is the Airgead Banking App, which I developed to help students understand the power of compound interest and fiscal responsibility. The application allows users to input investment details and visualize how their investments will grow over time, meeting the educational needs outlined by Airgead Banking.

Achievements
One aspect I did particularly well was ensuring the application met all functional requirements while maintaining clean and readable code. I implemented object-oriented programming principles effectively, resulting in a modular and maintainable codebase.

Areas for Enhancement
While the project was successful, there are areas where I could enhance the code. For instance, I could optimize the performance by refining the interest calculation algorithms. Additionally, implementing more robust input validation would make the application more secure against invalid or malicious data.

Challenges and Solutions
The most challenging part of the code was applying the compound interest formula we were given accurately and efficiently. It was difficult to apply what we learned in class, but after referring to our textbook and trying small examples, I was able to apply what I learned to the assignment.

Transferable Skills
Skills gained from this project, such as object-oriented programming, algorithm optimization, and secure coding practices, will be highly transferable to other projects and coursework. These skills are fundamental in developing efficient and secure applications across different domains.

Code Maintainability
To ensure the program is maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I adhered to best practices such as clear naming conventions, modular design, and thorough documentation. While there is no README file, each file contains comments at the beginning explaining how the file works, providing clarity and facilitating future updates or modifications.
